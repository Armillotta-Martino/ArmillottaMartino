# Armillotta Martino

Hi, I'm Martino 👋

I’m a passionate software developer who loves turning ideas into real, functional, and elegant solutions. Over the years, I’ve built experience across multiple programming languages and frameworks, developing applications that are both efficient and user-friendly. I’m driven by curiosity and a constant desire to improve — whether it’s learning new technologies, optimizing performance, or crafting cleaner architectures.

I regularly challenge myself on LeetCode, practicing algorithms and data structures to sharpen my problem-solving skills and maintain a high standard of code quality.

## 🚁 FPV Drones
Beyond the screen, I’m an FPV drone enthusiast — there’s nothing quite like the thrill of flying at high speed, exploring new perspectives, and capturing the world from above. This passion for flight connects deeply with my love of technology, precision, and hands-on experimentation. Traveling also fuels my creativity, exposing me to new landscapes and ideas that often inspire my projects.

## 🎮 Video Games & Creativity
Video games have always fascinated me — not just as entertainment, but as a perfect mix of creativity, logic, and design. This passion led me to explore game development with Unity and 3D modeling with Blender, where I love giving form to ideas and creating interactive worlds that blend art and technology.

## 🧩 3D Printing
My journey with FPV drones naturally introduced me to 3D printing. I started with FDM printing and later moved to resin printing, using my 3D modeling experience to design and produce custom drone parts. The combination of software, design, and physical prototyping has made this one of my favorite creative outlets.

## 🧗 Extreme Sports
I’ve always been drawn to adrenaline-fueled activities, especially parkour, which taught me discipline, precision, and perseverance — values I carry into both my coding and creative projects.
